    description: `A sustainability-driven fashion app that helps you get the most out of your closet while cutting down on clothing waste. With just a photo, you can pin your clothes into a digital wardrobe, track how often you wear each piece, and get reminders when items haven’t been worn in a while. The app suggests nearby thrift shops and donation spots, letting you earn points for re-wearing/donating clothes -- creating a circular fashion system. Watch our <a href="https://youtu.be/glGl5sb8sMw" target="_blank" class="text-gray-400 hover:text-indigo-400">demo</a> and fun <a href="https://youtu.be/60EXv8GitFc" target="_blank" class="text-gray-400 hover:text-indigo-400">promo</a> video!`,
