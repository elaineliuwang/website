**Hello, I'm Elaine!** I'm a junior at MIT studying Computer Science and Business Analytics. I'm currently based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but 
originally from Des Moines, Iowa.

My interests lie in the realm of software development, data management, and cloud computing—particularly in finance, entertainment, and emerging tech. 
I'm passionate about creating and bringing ideas to life, and once I’m in, I’m *all* in. 

While I'm not working, I also compete on the Track & Field team, scale new bouldering routes, get lost in a good <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/elaineliuwang

<a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017WANE01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speed-solve</a>
 all sorts of Rubik's Cubes, and go to concerts whenever I can!
